homebrew-compat
===============

This repository exists for the sole purpose of providing me with compatibility
formula that will most likely never get accepted by the main project.

The formula are mainly here because I need to build certain ones with
C++11/libc++ support along with the original libraries under an older version
of the C++ standard and libstdc++.
